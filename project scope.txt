PREDICTING LIFE EXPECTANCY USING MACHINE LEARNING

PROJECT SUMMARY

It is a Regression Machine Learning project which is aimed at predicting average life expectancy rate of various countries taking in account of several feature which serve as a historical data such as Regional variations, Economic circumstances, Sex ratios, Mental illness, Physical illness, Education, Year of their birth and other demographic factors.
This problem statement provides a way to predict average life expectancy of people living in the country, expenditure on healthcare system, and some specific disease related deaths happened in the country.

PROJECT REQUIREMENT

An appropriate machine learning model. Here linear regression model is used as it incorporates various features and the predictions are the continuos values.
Python programming language.
Appropriate cloud platform such as IBM.
Libraries would also be required such as NUMPY, PANDAS, etc.
Tool to generate URL for the model to be accessible globally.

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS


  At the FRONT-end, a webpage taking the necessary inputs from the user to implement the designed model.

At the BACK-end, the input get processed and finally gives the desired output, here the predicting average life expectancy.

Technical / Software Requirements
Accuracy of the sysytem might not be the 100% , but gives a fair output which is much reliable.
Its is simple to access and is manageable.
Good internet connection.
Cloud.
Python/R IDE.


PROJECT DELIVERABLES

This project delivers the predicted average life expectancy based on the input provided.

PROJECT TEAM

Individual person.

PROJECT SCHEDULE

30 Days.
